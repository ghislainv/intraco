# Objectives

## Objectives

We suggest discussing four main points on Monday. These four main points have emerged
from the “outstanding questions” section in the TREE article and from our previous
workshops.

\vspace{1cm}

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/cover-article-TREE}

## Point 1

1. **What are the consequences of including a random IV in place of an environmentally-driven IV in theoretical community models ?** First results from a
theoretical community model by Camille.

\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/coexistence}

## Point 2

2. **Is the spatial autocorrelation of tree growth due to environmental or dispersal factors?** How would it be possible to test for the effect of environmental variables or
dispersal factors on tree growth spatial autocorrelation?

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/spatial-autocorrelation}

## Point 3

3. **How to correctly structure IV in space and time in theoretical community dynamics/forest dynamics models in order to obtain species coexistence?** Discussion
could start from results obtained by Clark et al. 2007 and Purves et al. 2014.

## Point 4

4. **How the nature of IV and the relationship between observed species attribute and inferred performance impact the effect of IV on species coexistence?** A modelling
framework example.

## Tasks and subgroups

Based on the discussion of these four main points, the idea is to identify **two to three tasks** that could be tackled in **subgroups** during the rest of the week.

On Tuesday morning: short official presentation of **Cesab** and **sDiv** by Nicolas Mouquet and Marten Winter.

# Excursion

## Car ride

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/excursion}

- Leaving Cesab around 14:30
- ~40 min driving

## Small walk

\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/walk}

- Arrival at Col du Fambetou before 16:00
- About 1 hour walking (maximum)
- View point from the Castle of Viviourès.

## Wine testing

\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Mas_Bruguiere}

- At 17:00
- Very good (white and red) wines from appelation "Pic Saint Loup".
- https://mas-bruguiere.com/
- About 45 min. Back in Montpellier at 19:00 for diner.
