# Position as ecologist at Cirad (2009-now)

- Community ecology and applied statistics

\vspace{0.25cm}

- Expatriated in Madagascar (3 years)
- Detached at JRC (EC research center) in Italy (3 years)
- Conservation ecology in tropical forests
- Main topics:
    - Species vulnerability to climate change
    - Role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle

# Forecasting tropical forest cover in the future

- Spatial model of tropical deforestation at high resolution
- Under a business-as-usual scenario
- Maps of the deforestation risk and potential futur forest cover
- <https://forestatrisk.cirad.fr>

# Species vulnerability to climate change

- Trait and phylogenetic data
- Joint Species Distribution Models
- Madagascar, French Guiana, and New Caledonia

# INTRACO project scientific motivations

- Confusion regarding nature and implications of intraspecific variability in ecology
- Concepts in temperate forests not yet well established for tropical forests
    - Stable coexistence in tropical forest (cf. Clark et al. 2003)
    - Niche multidimensionality and species coexistence in tropical forests
