# Context

## Importance of IV

### Species coexistence in tropical forest

One can encounter up to >900 plant species of a diversity of forms and functions in one hectare of tropical forest [@Wilson2012].

\centering \includegraphics[width=8cm]{figs/Intraco}

### Stable coexistence

Widespread evidence of stability in natural communities [@Clark2003c].

\centering \includegraphics[width=10cm]{figs/Clark2003-stability}

### Mechanisms of stable species coexistence

- More than 100 mechanisms have been proposed to prevent competitive exclusion [@Wright2002]
- Niche mechanisms: demographic trade-offs, resource partitioning, storage effect, intermediate disturbance hypothesis, Janzen-Connell
effect, etc.

\centering \includegraphics[width=8cm]{figs/Wright2002}

### No unified theory

\bcols
\bcol{0.5\textwidth}

- No single mechanism able to explain the **stable** coexistence of hundreds of species in hyper-diverse communities
- Few dominant species and many low-abundance species
- Many shade-tolerant species in tropical forests

### Intraspecific variability (IV)

- **Previous mechanisms**: all individuals within a species are considered equal
- **In nature**: high intraspecific variability: traits, allometry, demography
- Sources of IV:
    - Endogenous **genetic** variability
    - Exogenous biotic or abiotic **environmental** variability

### Intraspecific variability (IV)

\centering \includegraphics[width=6cm]{figs/Albert-ITV}

IV might have an effect on species coexistence?

$\Rightarrow$ Since 2003, many articles investigating the role of IV in species coexistence.

## Contrasting results

### Theoretical models with few species

\bcols
\bcol{0.5\textwidth}

@Lichstein2007, @Courbaud2012, @Uriarte2018, @Hart2016

\vspace{0.25cm}

Tests:

- Mean difference-variance ratio 
- Mean-variance trade-off
- Non-linearity of relationships between individual- and population-level performance
- Spatial structure of the variation among conspecific individuals

\ecol
\bcol{0.5\textwidth}

\centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{figs/species-niche-overlap-Lichstein2007}
Gaussian distributions of individual performance for two species. If intraspecific variance is
sufficiently large, the species niches overlap \citep{Lichstein2007}.

\ecol
\ecols

### Contrasting results

@Lichstein2007, @Courbaud2012, @Uriarte2018, @Hart2016

$\Rightarrow$ IV could either promote, hinder, or have no effect on species
coexistence.

## A different view

### A different view

\bcols
\bcol{0.5\textwidth}

- IV does not necessarily reveal intrinsic differences among conspecific individuals
- Observed IV **does not imply niche overlap**
- Observed IV **results from the multimensionality** of the niche: 1 individual = 1 species in a particular environment

\ecol
\bcol{0.5\textwidth}

\centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{figs/multidimensional-niche-Tokeshi1999}

\ecol
\ecols
  
### No consensus

- View defended by Clark et al. [@Clark2010; @Clark2007; @Clark2003d].
- Appearing **not well understood/shared** by the scientific community [@Hart2016; @Uriarte2018], but see @Falster2017.
- **Has not been demonstrated** yet for hyperdiverse communities such as tropical forests.

# Objectives

## Scientific objectives

### Scientific objectives

We aim at: "Unravelling the role of intraspecific variability in tree species coexistence in tropical forests"

- Explaining why previous studies obtained contrasting results
- Investigating further the fact that IV does not imply niche overlap
- Investigating further the link between IV and niche multimensionality

## Scientific tasks

### Scientific tasks

6 tasks that will be detailed further during the week.

- Data analysis
    - **Task A**:  Reproducing Clark (2010)'s analysis in **tropical** forests    
    (conspecific individuals answer more similarly than heterospecific individuals)
    - **Task B**:  Adapting Clark (2010)'s idea in **space**.
    - **Task C**:  Estimating the part of IV attributable to either **genetic or environmental** variability in EUCFLUX.
- Theoretical models
    - **Task D**:  Building **theoretical models** to test the effect of niche dimension and IV on coexistence.
- Review
    - **Task E**:  **Review and synthesis**: unifying framework of hypotheses.
- Empirical model
    - **Task F**:  Empirical **models intercomparison**: testing the role of IV on species coexistence using **simulators** of tropical forest dynamics.

### Long-term applied objectives

Long term objectives

- Including IV in tropical forest simulators
- Realistic simulations of tropical forest dynamics
- Inform policy makers and management people
