# Objectives

- Tree community dynamics model
- Realistic model with demographic processes: growth, fecundity or recruitment, mortality
- Species compete for resources (eg. light, water, nutrients)
- High dimensionality for species niche
- Density dependence mechanisms
- Concentrate competition within species (competition intra > competition inter)
- Easy to step from theoretical model to empirical models

# Environment, individual, and species

- Set of trees $i$ from different species $j$.
- Environment defined by a set of variables for each individual $X_i=x_{1,i},\ldots,x_{n,i}$.
- Micro-habitat with spatially autocorrelated variables.
- Each species $j$ will have a different set of growth parameters $\beta_j=\beta_{1,j},\ldots,\beta_{n,j}$ for each of the environmental variables.

# Demographic processes

Growth $G$:   
- Growth depending on tree size, environment, and competition.
- $G_i=f(\beta_j, X_i, \text{tree size}_i, \text{competition}_i)$.
- Competition index can be basal area locally.

Mortality $M$:    
- Mortality depending on tree size and growth (or only growth).
- (Mortality indirectly depends on environment and competition).
- $M_i=f(\text{size}_i, G_i)$.

Fecundity $F$:
- Fecundity depending on tree size.
- $F_i=f(\text{size}_i)$.

# Potential dynamics

- Species should increase in abundance in favorable habitats.
- Density dependence: in favorable habitats, abundance of the most performant species is limited by high intraspecific competition for resources.

# Objectives

$\checkmark$ Tree community dynamics model    
$\checkmark$ Realistic model with demographic processes: growth, fecundity or recruitment, mortality    
$\checkmark$ Species compete for resources    
$\checkmark$ High dimensionality for species niche    
$\checkmark$ Density dependence mechanisms    
$\checkmark$ Concentrate competition within species (competition intra > competition inter)    
$\checkmark$ Easy to step from theoretical model to empirical models

# Tests

With this simple model we could test or investigate:

- Effect of the number of dimensions on the number of coexisting species.
- The link with the Lotka-Volterra model (Georges' suggestion).
- The effect of spatially autocorrelated environmental variables
